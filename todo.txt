- draw structure of code refactor code making it simple including what happens when:
   - page blurs, unblurs, whitelist, dangerlist, change blur level



less priority
- clean code, it's very messy especiialy structure of it
- github code is blurred
- fix performance using mutation observer
- problem with keep.google.com:
This document requires 'TrustedScript' assignment. This script element was modified without use of TrustedScript assignment.
keep.google.com/:1 This document requires 'TrustedScript' assignment. An HTMLScriptElement was directly modified and will not be executed

- Fix performance by:
  - making mutation observer more efficient (making a list of visited nodes, seeing if there is overlap between added and mutated nodes, etc.)
  - reducing blur level and increasing introducing opacity, since blurring makes things slow
